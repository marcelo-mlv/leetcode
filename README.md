# Solving Leetcode Daily Challenges. 

In order to improve c++ end english skills, I have hereby challenged myself to solve those daily Leetcode challenges for as long as possible.

It's not ideal to set a goal of, for instance, 100 days. More important than the goals we set, is the consistency we maintain each day.

To be disciplined is not to focus on the goal, but on the everyday bit of distance we managed to walk further.

Joy is not found by achieving a certain objective, but rather the path we took to get there.
